# Quiz App
Made by **Brian Zhou** for *CPSC 210*

## What will the application do?
This is a Java app for students wanting to prepare for an exam. This app allows users
to create a quizzes with an arbitrary number of questions. After taking a quiz, users
will get feedback and a score. I choose this project idea because the subject aligns
with my goals - doing well on my tests.
